# Camillah!
A simple app created during my studies about Mean Stack development, joining my love for programming with the love for my girlfriend. I tried to create with clean codes and simple syntax an app that print "I love you Camilla!" in various languages, doing random select of the language and the country, but i also provided an option to select these countrys. So yeah, enjoy it.
